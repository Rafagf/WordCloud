WordCloud
=========

Source code of a work cloud in Perl scripting language.

This word cloud is set to retrieve feeds from the spanish website http://elpais.com/ (for example there is a simple html to select a feed of this website)
, but easily the word cloud functionality could be separated from this example and used in a generic way. If anyone is interested in how to do this just let me know!

It creates a html webpage containing a word cloud from a given feed. It is also possible to select one or several words of the word cloud and to obtain a list of news related to those words, ordered by the tf-idf (Term frequency – Inverse document frequency).
